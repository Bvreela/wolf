# RimWorld agent framework

Project artifacts for a provider-neutral AI framework that plans, decomposes goals
into tasks, cycles attention, chooses from bounded decision matrices, and learns
through reviewed evidence.

## Start here

- [Framework specification](rimworld-jev-plan.html) — architecture, human review,
  decision matrices, learning, evaluation, and rollout.
- [Interactive UI mockup](ui-mockup/index.html) — prototype dashboard with a
  schematic map, shelter choices, tasks, lesson review, and simulated controls.
  [Run instructions and game/agent architecture](ui-mockup/README.md).
- [Settings examples](settings/README.md) — human-editable settings, long-term
  plans, action workflows, building strategy, and lessons policy.
- [RimWorld guide transcript](rimworld-complete-guide-transcript.txt) — original
  reference material supplied for this project.

The domain order is **food → shelter → mood → research → combat**, with emergencies
able to interrupt. Planner and Decision Selector endpoints are independently
configurable. Building strategy accounts for effective available pawn capacity,
and persistent lessons preserve applicability, evidence, and counterexamples.

**Status:** specification, example settings, and an interactive browser mockup.
The RimAgent integration, spatial planner, runtime settings loader, lesson ledger,
and gameplay evaluation have not been implemented. Mockup data is illustrative.
